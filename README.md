This repository is to to help you with your `Array.Prototype` chops. The objective is to get each test to pass.

## How To

Make sure that you `npm install` to get all your dependencies. After you've done that you can run `npm run test-all` to run all of your tests. Alternatively you can run `npm test [name of test folder]` to run each testing suite individually.
