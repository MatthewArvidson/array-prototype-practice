This repository is to to help you with your `Array.Prototype` chops. The objective is to get each test to pass.

## How To

Make sure that you `npm install` to get all your dependencies. After you've done that you can run `npm test` to run all of your tests. Alternatively if you have `mocha` installed globally you can simply run `mocha [name of test folder]` and it will run your tests.
